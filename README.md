# Crossy Rogue
This repository contains a game project developed in Unity3D called Crossy Rogue. In Crossy Rogue, you play as a small knight exploring through five dungeon-like levels armed only with your torch for survival.

This game's development was a collaboration effort from myself and four colleagues. All five of us worked on every aspect of development for this project, but our specialties and accomplishments are briefly listed below.

I was the project lead, managing the majority of the development, debugging, and progress compilation. Additionally, I was the character development and animation specialist.

Danny Khan was the level design specialist, constructing each level out of assets from our library, and organizing the placements of characters, monsters, objects, and collectables.

David Wenzel was the scripting specialist. He was mainly responsible for scripting some of the core gameplay mechanics and skeleton code.

Andrew Owens was our UI specialist. He developed most of the game's UI, intro screen, and various object assets.

Jake Few was our audio specialist. He implemented all the sound effects for in-game assets and also implemented the in-game music.
